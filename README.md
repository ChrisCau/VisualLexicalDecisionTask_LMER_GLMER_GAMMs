Research title: *The cognitive processing od Serbian derived nouns with ambiguous and unambiguous suffixes (VLD task; LMER [Linear Mixed-Effect Regression] & GLMER [Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Regression])*

This **psycholinguistics study** was aimed at the experimental investigation of *the cognitive processing of Serbian derived nouns with ambiguous derivational suffixes* in **the visual lexical decision task**, one of the tasks which is most commonly used in the language processing research. **Two dependent variables** are measured in this study: **Reaction Time** (measured in millisecond) and **Accuracy** (true/false). In accordance with the type of dependent variable, **two different statistical analysis** were performed: **Linear Mixed-Effect Regression** (*LMER* -- for RT) and **Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Regression** (*GLMER* -- for Accuracy). The first dependent variable was selcted as appropriate for **continuous dependent variable**, while the second one was selected as a suitable one for **categorical dependent variable**. Code are written in the **R**.
