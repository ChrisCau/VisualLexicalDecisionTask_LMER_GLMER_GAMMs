# The cognitive processing od Serbian derived nouns with ambiguous suffixes

This **psycholinguistics study** was aimed in the investigation of *the cognitive processing of Serbian derived nouns with ambiguous derivational suffixes* in **the visual lexical decision task**, one of the task which is most commonly used in the language processing research. **Two dependent variables** are measured in this study: **Reaction Time** (measured in ms) and **Accuracy** (true/false). In accordance with the type of dependent variable, **two different statistical analysis** were performed: **Linear Mixed-Effect Regression** (*LMER* -- for RT) and **Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Regression** (*GLMER* -- for Accuracy). The first one was selcted as an appropriate for **continuous dependent variable**, while the second one was selected as an suitable one for **categorical dependent variable**. More detailed information about the experiment, as well as about the phenomenon of suffixal ambiguity itself, you can find at my personal webiste, where my conference/workshop presentations were uploaded. Code are written in the **R Project for Statistical Computing**.
