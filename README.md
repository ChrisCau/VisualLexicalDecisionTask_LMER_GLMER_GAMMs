This psycholinguistics study was aimed in the investigation of the cognitive processing of Serbian derived nouns with ambiguous derivational suffixes in the visual lexical decision task, one of the task which is most commonly used in the language processing research. Two dependent variables are measured in this study: reaction time (measured in ms) and accuracy (true/false). In accordance with the type of dependent variable, two different statistical analysis were performed: Linear Mixed Effect Regression (for RT) and Generalized Linear Mixed Model (for Accuracy). The first one was selcted as an appropriate for continuous dependent variable, while the second one was selected as an suitable one for categorical dependent variable. If you are interested in some details about phenomenon of the derivational suffix ambiguity in Serbian, experimental procedure etc., please contact me, or read some of my previous conference/workshop presentations:   Gatarić, I., &amp; Filipović Đurđević, D.
